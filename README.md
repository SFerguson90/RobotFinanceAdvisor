# RobotFinanceAdvisor using AWS

### AWS Tools Used
* AWS Lambda
* AWS Lex

### How does this program work?
This program works by creating Python code to AWS Lex, which is read into a Chatbot created by myself through AWS Lambda. By calling the code and using NLP to read user-input, the bot is able to recommend different portfolio types to the user. If the user is feeling risky, the bot will offer a more volatile option. The bot also opens a display window for clicking functionality, to choose an option.

### What are it's future implications?
The future implications are that, this RoboAdvisor could be used in conjunction with a Personal Financial Planner to better choose portfolios or even stocks for clients.
