# RobotFinanceAdvisor using AWS

### AWS Tools Used
* AWS Lambda
* AWS Lex

### How does this program work?
This program works by creating Python code to AWS Lex, which is read into a Chatbot created by myself through AWS Lambda. By calling the code and using NLP to read user-input, the bot is able to recommend different portfolio types to the user. If the user is feeling risky, the bot will offer a more volatile option. The bot also opens a display window for clicking functionality, to choose an option.

### What are it's future implications?
The future implications are that, this RoboAdvisor could be used in conjunction with a Personal Financial Planner to better choose portfolios or even stocks for clients. As I once heard, "Machine learning won't replace professionals completely, but it will replace the ones who don't or choose not to use it." This RoboAdvisor will help to bring in more clients and process customers quicker, improving revenue and growth for finance companies in the future.
